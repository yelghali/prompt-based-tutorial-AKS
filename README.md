# prompt-based-tutorial-AKS

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Kubernetes and containers to deploy a multi-container application. You will use ChatGPT or GPT4 to guide you through a series of prompts that will help you understand the concepts and commands involved in Kubernetes. The objective of this tutorial is to simplify learning based on a prompts-enabled tutorial.
